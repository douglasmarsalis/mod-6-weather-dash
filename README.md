# mod-6-weather-dash

## Description 

* For this project, I will create an application that will enable the user to search for weather in various cities of their choosing.
* This application will feature updated HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Third Party APIs.
* The webpage and code will be clean and will have a responsive user interface that will adjust to multiple screen sizes.
* I will make sure that my code follows industry standards and is sourced correctly.
* I will review my code, look for problems and fix those isses.
* By building this webpage, it has helped me to learn information on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Third Party APIs, GIT, GitHub, READme markdown information, and Deployment.

## User Story

AS A traveler 
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
